# Arrays-And-Strings-In-CPP
## Aim
To study and implement arrays and strings in C++.
## Tools
Visual Studio Code
## Theory
### What are arrays?
An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations. It allows you to store multiple values under a single name and access them using an index.Arrays are one of the most basic and commonly used data structures in C++ programming.

### What are strings?
In C++, strings are sequences of characters that are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information in the form of text. Strings are provided by <string> header file in the form of std::string class.C++ provides some inbuilt functions which are used for string manipulation, such as the strcpy() and strcat() functions for copying and concatenating strings.

## Algorithm

### Element Search In Arrays

### Finding Max & Min Element In Arrays

### Reversing A String

### Checking String For Palindrome

## Conclusion
We learnt to do different operations on strings and arrays like reversing, finding length,searching element , etc.
